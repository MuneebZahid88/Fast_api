This project is a backend API built using FastAPI, designed to provide a structured and scalable RESTful service. It includes modular routing for features such as user management, authentication, and data handling, along with database integration using PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy. The application follows clean architecture principles with separate models, schemas, and routers, ensuring maintainability and scalability. It also leverages FastAPI’s automatic request validation and interactive API documentation, making development and testing efficient.
